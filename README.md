# Project 9: Around the US

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
This is my Fifth Javascript enabled project, and the first to be connected to an external Server via API.

**Technologies used to create the Project**

- HTML - Makes up the markup of index.html
- CSS - Used to make the website reactive to different Viewport sizes
- Javascript - Used to make the popup menu, and save the input string with a submit button, Form validations and new for Project 7, OOP with new classes, seperate JS files, and a more maintainable code.
- WebPack - was used to seperate JS into moudles and than minify the code.
- Figma - for the Design layout
