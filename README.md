# Project 7: Around the US

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
This is my Third Javascript enabled project.

**Technologies used to create the Project**

- HTML - Makes up the markup of index.html
- CSS - Used to make the website reactive to different Viewport sizes
- Javascript - Used to make the popup menu, and save the input string with a submit button, Form validations and new for Project 7, OOP with new classes, seperate JS files, and a more maintainable code.
